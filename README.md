## Project Overview

I want to build a simple LED circuit that activates when a button is pushed. This will utilize a PCB.

## Educational Value Added

By persuing this project, I will be learning how to create simple PCB's, and learn how to use the necessary softwares behind it (such as KiCad). I will also be able to implement my soldering skills into this project, allowing me additional practice with these tools.
