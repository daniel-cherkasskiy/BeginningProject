## Current Status
Researching into the required parts.

## Project Overview

I want to build the pip boy device from the video game series _Fallout_. This will act as a small touchscreen computer that is attached to the forearm.

## Educational Value Added

By persuing this project, I will be learning how to work with Raspberry Pi's, and learn how to operate and configure the operating system. I will also be able to implement my programming skills into this project, allowing me additional practice with my skills.
